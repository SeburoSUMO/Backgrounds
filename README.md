# Backgrounds

This is a rough guide to using the Firefox Developer Tools to make a background from a website. (This guide references descriptions taken from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/UI_Tour.)

1 - Make sure that the website has a large background image.  
2 - Open the Inspector tool.  It can be found in the Web Developer menu, or press Ctrl+Shift+C  
3 - Use the Select Element Button to select a part of the page you do not want in your desktop.  A good example might be text on top of the image.  
4 - In the CSS Pane, under Element, type `visibility` and set the value to `hidden`    
5 - Use the Responsive Design Mode to make sure the image is the right size for you screen.    
6 - Use the Box Model in the Layout Pane to resize the image.     
7 - When you are happy with the finished wallpaper, use the Screenshot function in the Responsive Design Mode to save the image.

If you see any of your intellectual property here and wish it to be removed, it is no problem at all.  Just submit an issue clearly stating the filename and I will remove the image and any Firefox theme I have created from it.
